# Wizard Application

## Project Overview

You are creating a wizard-based UI for getting required information from a user.

## Demo Requirements

- Create a three-step wizard flow
- Each step must contain:
  - One form control of your choice
  - One validator
- Prevent users from advancing to the next step if validation fails
- When the wizard is completed, instead of sending the results to a backend service, print all user inputs to the browser console as a single object
- Support saved state so that if a user leaves their browser session, they may come back to it at a later time
  - State may be saved in the browser for this application
  - Be prepared to explain how you might save state using a backend service
- The application must run locally in a browser and function correctly at both desktop and mobile viewport sizes
- The application may mock the backend services that you would consider using to support the application

## Implementation Requirements

- Use Typescript
- If using a frontend framework such as Angular, React, or Vue, use the latest version of that framework
- You may use any additional libraries if desired
- Demonstrate a well-structured application with reusable components
- Style the application in any manner you please to reflect effective and maintainable CSS practices
- Provide a Git repository with your code
- Provide instructions for running the application locally
- Be prepared to walk through your code and explain your architectural decisions
  - You should be able to explain it to a junior developer and give them guidance on how to implement new features using your application as a base
  - You should be able to explain how your application would interact with a backend service if one was available
